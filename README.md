The Bus Travel Display System (BTDS) allows commuters to track the real-time location of their bus, as well as track the capacity of buses to prevent overcrowding. The system is combined of a mobile application developed using Flutter and being showcased on an android emulator on a Next Unit of Computing (NUC) that is connected to a monitor that is being installed at the corner of the bus interior. This project was inspired by the display system that is already existing in our local public buses in Singapore where it has shown evidence of improving commuter's awareness of the upcoming bus stops and reduces the chances of them missing their bus stop.
